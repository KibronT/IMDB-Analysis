# IMDB-Analysis
This project applies regression analysis on the IMDB dataset to uncover relationships between Ratings, Metascore, and Gross earnings. It builds linear regression models to predict Metascore based on Ratings and Gross, while also exploring multiple regression techniques with additional explanatory variables. Through statistical modeling, visualizations, and insights derived from quartile analysis, the project identifies key factors influencing movie performance.
